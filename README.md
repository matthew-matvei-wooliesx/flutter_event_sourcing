# event_sourcing

A simple Flutter project to explore and demonstrate Event Sourcing

## Where to Look

This project has been bootstrapped in the usual Flutter way. Ignore `lib/main.dart`, look at the other files in that
folder instead. `route.dart` would likely be the best file to start, then the `in_memory_route_repository.dart`, then
the use cases after that. 

## How to Look

Once you have a general idea of what's going on here in this branch, you can contrast this with the `with-event-sourcing`
branch. There is a draft PR to make the comparison easier available [here](https://github.com/matthew-matvei-wooliesx/flutter_event_sourcing/pull/1). You may also want to run the project, you can do this on any platform by running
(assuming you have the Flutter SDK installed):

```dart
flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html
```
